%   V. Lempitsky, 2011
%   INPUT:
%       nBaseRegions -- number of leaves in the segmentation tree
%       Tree -- segmentation tree, that is (number non-leaf nodes)-by-2 list in the
%               format returned by matlab's 'cluster' function
%       U - 1x(number of all nodes/regions) arbitrary unary terms for
%               regions
%       V - 3x(number of edges between the leaf regions). Each column
%               should give the numbers of the two connected leaves and the
%               strength of the edge
%       additionalUnaries(optional) - additional unary terms for the x variables of leaf nodes only. Can
%               be used, e.g., to express Hamming loss during max-margin learning
%   OUTPUT:
%       labels -- output in 'x' notation (labels each node in the tree with
%               0,or 1). Use 'pylonConvertLabels' to obtain region
%               labels (i.e. set of regions that have been assigned to the foreground).
